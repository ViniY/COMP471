# COMP471 Probabilistic Machine Learning

A very interesting course, I think its quite hard if you wanna really understand everything in this course. But it worth you taking some time and look into it. 
Many useful concepts and techniques covered by this course. Such as inference, sampling, MDP, probability simulation and...... 

Although I put lotta time into this course, I just get an A-. : ( 
The assignments are really interesting and challenging, it wont take much time on coding and writing but you need to think really hard, and understand what you are doing. 

If you are doing this course I highly recommend you read the book "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective" by Kevin P. Murphy (P.s. A legend : - D )

Hope you are doing well and enjoy this course.
